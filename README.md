The **Automated Recipe Generator** is a web-based application that allows users to input available ingredients and generate customized recipes. The application leverages:  
- **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for the frontend and backend development.  
- **FastAPI** to handle Llama-2 finetuned Large Language Model (LLM) inference requests for recipe generation.  
- **Llama-2 finetuned LLM** as the core model to generate recipes intelligently.
